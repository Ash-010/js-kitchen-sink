    <!-- <script src="main.js"></script> Adding the script before the actual HTML code without 
        "defer" attribute would result in an error as there is no DOM to work with as the JS code
         would be loaded before the html  -->
    <script src="main.js" defer></script>
    <!-- Using defer attribute in layman terms would instruct the compiler to keep loading the html
         along with this script(different threads) but not parse it until html page is completely rendered(DOMContentLoaded event is fired) -->
    <script async src="main.js"></script>
    <!-- The async attribute tells the browser to load the script on a different thread(asynchronously)
         but keep in mind that in case of multiple scripts it should only be used if there are no dependencies amon them -->
